# Basic Selectel DNS V2 with one project in terraform file

This example provides a simple project with dns v2 zones and rrsets.

To run this example you need to set `OS_DOMAIN_NAME` (your account id), `OS_USERNAME`, `OS_PASSWORD`, `SEL_PROJECT_ID` variables with authentication info that you can get from the [service users](https://my.selectel.ru/profile/users_management/users?type=service) page.

You can find additional examples in the [selectel/terraform-examples](https://github.com/selectel/terraform-examples).
